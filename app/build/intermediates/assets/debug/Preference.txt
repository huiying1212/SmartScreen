I aim to minimize cell phone use, especially in the evenings, to support better sleep and overall well-being.

I prefer to read books before bed as a calming and enriching habit.

I value health, early sleep, and maintaining a consistent daily routine.

I consider myself organized and intentional with my time and habits.
